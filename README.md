# Conn-Unity — Landing Page (Frontend)

A modern, responsive landing page for **Conn-Unity**, a community platform for creators to share ideas, connect, and explore meaningful conversations. This repo contains only the **frontend code** (HTML, CSS, JS).

## Features
- Responsive hero section with floating card  
- Metrics animation using vanilla JS  
- Feature grid showcasing key benefits  
- Call-to-action band for sign-ups  
- Footer with community guidelines and contact links  
- Modern CSS styling with gradients, flexbox, and grid  

## Demo
Open `welcomepage.html` in your browser or run a local server:  
```bash

├── README.md

If you want, I can also make a **version with GitHub badges (HTML5, CSS3, JS) and a preview image** that looks professional at the top of the repo.  

Do you want me to do that?
